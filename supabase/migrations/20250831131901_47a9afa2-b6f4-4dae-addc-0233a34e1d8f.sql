-- Fix critical security vulnerabilities identified in the security scan

-- 1. Fix user_invitations table - restrict public read access
-- Drop the overly permissive policy that allows everyone to read invitations
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view invitations sent to their email" ON user_invitations;

-- Create a proper policy that only allows the invited user to see their own invitation
CREATE POLICY "Invited users can view their own invitations" 
ON user_invitations 
FOR SELECT 
USING (
  auth.email() = email AND status = 'PENDING' AND expires_at > now()
);

-- 2. Ensure beta_signups RLS is properly configured
-- The existing policy should work, but let's make sure RLS is enabled
ALTER TABLE beta_signups ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 3. Add RLS policies to processos_live table (currently has no protection)
ALTER TABLE processos_live ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies for processos_live similar to processos table
CREATE POLICY "Only admins can manage processos live data" 
ON processos_live 
FOR ALL 
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles p
    WHERE p.user_id = auth.uid() 
    AND p.organization_id = processos_live.org_id 
    AND p.role = 'ADMIN'::user_role
  )
);

CREATE POLICY "Restricted access to processos live data" 
ON processos_live 
FOR SELECT 
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles p
    WHERE p.user_id = auth.uid() 
    AND p.organization_id = processos_live.org_id 
    AND can_access_sensitive_data(auth.uid())
  )
);

-- 4. Additional security: Add policy to prevent unauthorized inserts on beta_signups from authenticated users
-- The current policy allows any authenticated user to insert, let's make it more specific
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Beta signups are public for insert" ON beta_signups;

-- Allow inserts but with rate limiting considerations (public access for beta signups)
CREATE POLICY "Public can create beta signups" 
ON beta_signups 
FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Add a comment for documentation
COMMENT ON TABLE beta_signups IS 'Beta signup data - READ access restricted to admins only, PUBLIC insert allowed';
COMMENT ON TABLE user_invitations IS 'User invitations - READ access restricted to invited user and admins only';
COMMENT ON TABLE processos_live IS 'Live processes data - Protected with RLS policies matching processos table';
